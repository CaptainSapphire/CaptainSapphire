Hello everyone!
My Name is **Priya Harry.** *(she/her)* <br><br>
I am a incoming college freshman for Fall 2025. I am majoring in Data Science, and planning to transfer from Moorpark College to a UC/CSU. I graduated from Oak Park High School with Magna Cum Lade with Highest Honors. ðŸŽ“ <br><br>
I have a drive for learning and a passion for creativity. I enjoy website design with HTML/CSS/Javascript, data analysis in R, game development in C#, and more in Python. I'm always looking to add to this list, 
though!!ðŸ˜„ðŸ“–<br><br>
